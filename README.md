## Project Overview

The Sign Language Translator is an educational web application designed to facilitate the learning and practice of sign language through computer vision technology. This application leverages MediaPipe and TensorFlow frameworks to provide real-time recognition and feedback of hand gestures and body positions, creating an interactive learning environment.

## Educational Value

This project serves as a practical demonstration of how computer vision technology can be applied to educational contexts, specifically language acquisition. The system provides:

- Immediate feedback on gesture accuracy
- Structured learning progression
- Comprehensive reference materials
- Performance assessment capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe Pose and Hands
- **Visual Rendering**: MediaPipe Drawing Utilities
- **Camera Interface**: MediaPipe Camera Utilities
- **UI Enhancement**: Font Awesome icon library

### Functional Modules

1. **Practice Mode**
   - Real-time sign recognition
   - Immediate feedback system
   - Visual demonstration of available signs

2. **Learning Mode**
   - Sequential, step-by-step lessons
   - Progress tracking
   - Guided practice with feedback

3. **Dictionary**
   - Searchable sign database
   - Categorized sign collection
   - Detailed execution instructions

4. **Challenge Mode**
   - Timed assessment at varying difficulty levels
   - Performance metrics
   - Results sharing capability

## System Requirements

- **Hardware**: Computer with webcam
- **Software**: Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
- **Connectivity**: Internet connection for initial library loading

## Installation and Deployment

### Local Development with Visual Studio Code

The recommended method for running this application during development:

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Use the Live Server extension:
   - Right-click on `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   - The application will open in your default browser

### Alternative Deployment Methods

#### Python HTTP Server
```
python -m http.server
# Access via http://localhost:8000
```

#### Node.js HTTP Server
```
npm install -g http-server
http-server
# Access via http://localhost:8080
```

## Application Structure

```
├── index.html          # Main application interface
├── loginpage.html      # Authentication interface
├── AI2.js              # Core recognition and application logic
├── AIcss.css           # Main application styling
├── style.css           # Authentication interface styling
└── script.js           # Authentication logic
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Grant camera permissions when prompted
   - Position yourself with adequate lighting and a neutral background

2. **Navigation**
   - Use the top navigation bar to switch between application modes
   - Each mode provides specific functionality for learning and practicing

3. **Controls**
   - Toggle Camera: Enable/disable webcam feed
   - Capture Sign: Manually trigger sign recognition
   - Toggle Fullscreen: Expand/contract the application view

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues
- Verify browser permissions
- Ensure no other applications are using the camera
- Try refreshing the page or restarting the browser

### Recognition Accuracy
- Ensure adequate lighting conditions
- Position yourself with upper body and hands clearly visible
- Follow the specific instructions for each sign

## Authentication System

For demonstration purposes, the application includes a simulated login system. Any email and password combination will grant access to the main application.

## Educational Applications

This project demonstrates several educational technology principles:

- **Multimodal Learning**: Combines visual, textual, and kinesthetic learning
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provides real-time assessment of performance
- **Structured Progression**: Organizes content in increasing complexity
- **Self-Paced Learning**: Allows users to progress at their own speed
